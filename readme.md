##Mission
 
The Student Success Dashboard is a student‚Äêlevel data aggregation tool enabling the collection and connection of data from multiple sources.  Communities will be able to better organize academic and nonacademic data for analysis, service coordination, resource allocation, and continuous improvement. With data available by student, school, district, program, and service, SSD supports the practice of continuous improvement as well as evaluation and research.  The dashboard:
 
-  Enables integration of student-level demographic and academic data with services and support data from learning partners who serve students both in and out of school
-  Helps spotlight places where schools and community partners can invest resources to have the most impact on student success
-  Helps drive data-informed decision making for schools, districts, partners, funders, and other education stakeholders
